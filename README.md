## About
Designed and built by Patrick (_abazilla_)

The purpose of the project primarily is for my own learning and experimentation. Throughout this project I will be implemening both what I have learned in my time at CoderFactory Academy, as well as personal interest/development. 

## The Game
The game itself is based of the popular game/tv show Pok√©mon. It encompasses the battle sequence at this stage, where a pokemon performs "moves" against another, and will deal damage to the opponent.

The game features very basic functionality similar to that of the real game, with each pokemon and move having a particular type, to critical hits.
